#  Bioinformatics Toolkit
This repository contains a curated collection of **bioinformatics learning materials**, coding exercises, and algorithmic problem-solving scripts developed during my self-paced journey into **computational biology**. It includes:

- Solutions to Rosalind bioinformatics problems, grouped by topic and concept  
- Python and R scripts for core bioinformatics workflows, including data wrangling, statistical analysis, and visualization  

##  Topics Covered

- DNA & RNA sequence manipulation  
- GC content, transcription, translation  
- Parsing FASTA and FASTQ files  
- Using Pandas, NumPy, and Biopython  
- Statistical testing and visualization (ggplot2, seaborn)  
- Rosalind problem solving

##  Work in Progress

I continuously update this repo as I:

- Solve more problems  
- Learn new tools

##  Learning Goals

This repository helps me:

-  Strengthen Python and R programming for life sciences  
-  Practice algorithms relevant to sequence analysis and genomics  
-  Learn key bioinformatics operations like parsing, alignment, visualization
