# Rosalind Bioinformatics Problem Solutions

This folder contains my solutions to bioinformatics challenges from [Rosalind.info](https://rosalind.info/), organized by problem ID.

Each folder contains:
- The Python solution
- A link to the original problem
- Based on sample data from the Rosalind problem

## Notes

- These problems help build basic Python programming skills relevant for bioinformatics.
- Sample inputs from Rosalind are used to test solutions.
- All solutions are implemented in Python 3.
